            <h1>hi i'm anand.
            </h1>
            <p> I’m a passionate BCA student and aspiring software developer with a strong interest in building efficient, user-friendly applications. I enjoy turning ideas into functional digital experiences through clean code and thoughtful design.

Currently, I’m strengthening my foundations in programming, data structures, and web development while working on practical projects to sharpen my problem-solving skills. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and improving to grow into a skilled and reliable developer.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/aan4ndd/odin-landing-page">Odin project landing page</a>
            <p>This landing page was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to strengthen my understanding of core web development fundamentals.
                 The project focuses on structuring content using semantic HTML and styling layouts effectively with CSS.
                <br>I implemented a clean and responsive design with properly structured sections, including a hero area, information blocks, call-to-action section, and footer.
                 The project helped me improve my understanding of flexbox, alignment, spacing, and overall layout design principles.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/aan4ndd/rock-paper-scissors">Rock Paper Scissors Game</a>
            <p>This interactive Rock Paper Scissors game was built to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.
                 The project allows users to play against the computer, with real-time result updates and score tracking.
                <br>Through this project, I improved my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and ability to structure clean, 
                readable code while building a fully functional interactive web application.

            <a href="https://github.com/aan4ndd/etch-a-sketch">Etch-a-Sketch</a>
            <p>This Etch A Sketch project was built to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and dynamic element creation.
                 The application allows users to draw on a customizable grid by hovering over squares, creating an interactive sketching experience directly in the browser.
                <br>I implemented dynamic grid generation using JavaScript, enabling users to adjust the grid size while maintaining responsiveness. 
                The project helped me practice working with event listeners, loops, and DOM updates to create smooth, interactive functionality.
